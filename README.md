Top Hacker News scraper and basic presenter

https://jackswebbrand.github.io/betterhn/

Scrapes Hacker News for articles with over 50 votes on the first two pages and displays them with links to the main articles.

Functionality currently does not allow for updating when visiting the page - python script for scraping can only be run separate from the browser - so relies on pushing after running the script for updated news links. This will be addressed in the future with simple server.
    - Currently set to update every hour via cronjob
